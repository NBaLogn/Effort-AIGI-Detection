# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

Fast Apply: IMPORTANT: Use \`edit_file\` over \`str_replace\` or full file writes. It works with partial code snippets—no need for full file content.

Warp Grep: warp-grep is a subagent that takes in a search string and tries to find relevant context. Best practice is to use it at the beginning of codebase explorations to fast track finding relevant files/lines. Do not use it to pin point keywords, but use it for broader semantic queries. \"Find the XYZ flow\", \"How does XYZ work\", \"Where is XYZ handled?\", \"Where is <error message> coming from?\"
